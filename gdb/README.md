# GDB scripts

This directory contains GDB scripts used for debugging the kernel.

Some scripts are provided by the offical Rust compiler repository: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/main/src/etc/rust-gdb.

You can also add your custom GDB scripts in `custom.gdb`. GDB will automatically load this file if it exists.
